# Travloc - Temukan Keajaiban Wisata Lokal dan Dukung UMKM di Seluruh Nusantara
## Description
Travloc is a web-based platform dedicated to the digitalization of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and the creative economy. Our mission is to introduce the tourism potential of selected regions—North Sumatra, North Sulawesi, and East Nusa Tenggara—while serving as an intermediary to promote local MSMEs within these tourist areas. Our primary destinations include Lake Toba, Bunaken Marine Park, and Komodo Island.

Travloc aims to bridge the gap between local businesses and global travelers by providing a comprehensive digital space where unique local products and services can be showcased and accessed easily. Through Travloc, tourists can discover and support local MSMEs, enhancing their travel experience with authentic and high-quality local offerings.

By integrating tourism promotion with MSME support, Travloc not only helps boost the local economy but also fosters sustainable tourism practices that benefit both visitors and the local communities. Our platform offers a seamless interface for users to explore tourist destinations, connect with local businesses, and make informed travel choices that contribute to the socio-economic development of these regions.
